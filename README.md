<h2> Where are you from? </h2>

I am from Japan raised there and moved here to Chicago in 2009, and I call this city my hometown. 

<h2> IT Interest </h2>

I love IT overall and I love to play games. I am a QA Tester for pharmaceutrical company located in Lincolnshire, so it makes this class even wonderful before completing this program. 

<h2> Something Interesting About You </h2>

I play cricket during summer time with my friends. We keep tournaments to compete to semi-professional. I love to play it again once this pandemic is gone but that is going to take for sometime, so let us be safe until we can be normal again with each other.
